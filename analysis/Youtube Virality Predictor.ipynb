By gathering daily trending video statistics, we seek to uncover the patterns and factors that contribute to a video's virality.  \n","\n","## 🛠️ How the Data is Collected  \n","The data is automatically collected using the **YouTube API** and stored in this GitHub repository:  \n","🔗 [Trending Video Metadata](https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality/tree/main/assets/meta/trending)  \n","\n","The main project repository can be found here: https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality\n","\n","### **Data Collection Process**  \n","1. **Fetching Trending Videos**:  \n","   - We start by retrieving the latest trending videos from **multiple countries** via the **YouTube API**.  \n","   - These trending videos are stored in JSON format in our repository.  \n","\n","2. **Daily Statistics Updates**:  \n","   - Each day, a GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically to **gather fresh statistics** for all stored trending videos.  \n","   - The script fetches video engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, etc.) and updates them in JSON files.  \n","   - The updated dataset is saved here:  \n","     🔗 [Video Statistics](https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality/tree/main/assets/meta/video_stats)  \n","\n","## 🔍 Objectives  \n","- **Understand Viral Trends**: Identify factors that make a video go viral across different countries.  \n","- **Statistical Analysis**: Explore engagement trends (views, likes, shares) over time.  \n","- **Machine Learning Models**: Build predictive models to estimate a video's likelihood of becoming viral.  \n","\n","## 📊 Dataset & Features  \n","Our dataset consists of **daily trending videos** from multiple regions, with key features such as:  \n","- **Video Metadata**: Title, description, channel, published date, tags  \n","- **Engagement Metrics**: Views, likes, comments, favorites  \n","- **Technical Details**: Duration, resolution, captions availability  \n","- **Categorical Information**: Topic categories, privacy settings, license type  \n","\n","## 🛠️ Methodology  \n","1. **Data Collection**: Fetch trending video data daily using the YouTube API.  \n","2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Standardizing, handling missing values, and processing categorical features.  \n","3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualizing key trends in video engagement across countries.  \n","4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful attributes (e.g., video age, growth rate).  \n","5. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models (classification, regression) to predict virality.  \n","6. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Understanding model results and key drivers of viral content.  \n","\n","## 🚀 Expected Outcomes  \n","- A **comprehensive dataset** of YouTube trending videos across multiple countries.  \n","- Insights into **what makes a video go viral** based on statistical analysis.  \n","- Predictive models that can estimate a video's potential virality.  \n","- Open-source tools for **researchers, content creators, and marketers** to better understand online video trends.
