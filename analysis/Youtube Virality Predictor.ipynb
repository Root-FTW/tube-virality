This project goes beyond simply analyzing existing APIs; we are **building a custom API** to retrieve metadata‚Äîincluding view counts, likes, and descriptions‚Äîfrom YouTube videos and channels.\n","\n","### **Key Objectives**  \n","- ‚úÖ **Develop a custom API** to fetch YouTube video statistics.  \n","- ‚úÖ **Collect trending videos** from various countries and store historical data.  \n","- ‚úÖ **Analyze the collected data** to identify trends and patterns in virality.  \n","- ‚úÖ **Build predictive models** to estimate a video's potential to go viral.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üõ†Ô∏è How the Data is Collected  \n","\n","The data is automatically collected using the **YouTube API** and stored in this GitHub repository:  \n","üîó [Trending Video Metadata](https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality/tree/main/assets/meta/trending)  \n","\n","### **Collection Process**  \n","1. **Fetching Trending Videos**  \n","   - Using the YouTube API, trending videos from multiple countries are retrieved.  \n","   - The list of trending videos is stored and continuously updated.  \n","\n","2. **Daily Statistics Updates** (Automated via **GitHub Actions**)  \n","   - A scheduled **GitHub Actions** workflow updates video statistics (views, likes, comments, etc.).  \n","   - These updates provide **historical trends** for analysis.  \n","   - The latest data is stored here:  \n","     üîó [Video Statistics](https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality/tree/main/assets/meta/video_stats)  \n","\n","```mermaid\n","graph TD;\n","    A[trending.py: Fetch Trending Videos] -->|Generates daily JSON files - one per country| B[trending_db.py: Aggregate Trending Data];\n","    B -->|Merges all country JSONs into a unified CSV| C[video_stats.py: Extract & Fetch Video Stats];\n","    C -->|Creates a daily JSON file with statistics for all videos| D[video_stats_db.py: Compile Video Stats History];\n","    D -->|Combines all daily stats JSONs into a final dataset| E[Complete Merged Video Stats JSON];\n","```\n","---\n","\n","## üîç Understanding Video Virality  \n","\n","### **What Defines a Viral Video?**  \n","A video's **virality** isn't simply measured by view count‚Äîit depends on engagement, growth rate, and audience reach.

\n","üìå **Rapid View Growth** ‚Äì Views gained in the first 24-48 hours.  \n","\n","For instance:  \n","- A YouTuber with **1M subscribers** getting **20M views** is expected.  \n","- A YouTuber with **10K subscribers** getting **2M views** is **extraordinary**.  \n","\n","Our models will classify videos as **\"success\" (viral)** or **\"non-success\"**, based on these metrics.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üìä Dataset & Features  \n","\n","Our dataset includes key **video metadata** and **engagement statistics**, such as:  \n","\n","- **Video Details**: Title, description, duration, resolution  \n","- **Engagement Metrics**: Views, likes, comments, favorite count  \n","- **Channel Details**: Subscriber count, total videos, upload frequency  \n","- **Trending History**: How long a video remains on the trending list  \n","- **Country-Based Analysis**: Virality trends across different regions  \n","\n","üìå **Goal:** Use these features to
