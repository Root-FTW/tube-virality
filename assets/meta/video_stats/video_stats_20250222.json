One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

        "description": "Super Bowl LIX is in the books. The Philadelphia Eagles are world champions. And Philly didn't just win vs the Kansas City Chiefs, it was unlike anything we've seen in Super Bowl history for many different reasons.\n\nJalen Hurts put up one of the greatest performances football has seen. Between the adjustments made due to the Chiefs intentions to stop Saquon Barkley, utilizing skill positions like AJ Brown, Devonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, Jahan Dotson, etc, Nick Sirianni and Kellen Moore did wonders against Steve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defense. And that includes the work from the offensive line in Lane Johnson, Mekhi Becton, and Jordan Mailata.\n\nThen in terms of the Eagles defense, you could argue this was even more dominant of a showing. Josh Sweat, Jalen Carter, Milton Williams, Nolan Smith, Zack Baun, Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell, you name it, the entire unit of Vic Fangio's had one of the best games ever seen on the biggest stage. And ultimately, it was a victory we won't soon forget in the fashion it occurred.\n\nAlso, give me ideas for other NFL videos, news, and discussions I should cover in the future. I read ALL comments.\n\nThank you so much for the support guys.\n\nMY NBA CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/c/HoopsDigest\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thehoopsdigest\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@hoopsdigest?l...\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

        "description": "The Chosen Season 5 in theaters March 28\n---\nI think I'm more excited to deliver this trailer than any we've done. Which isn't a coincidence because I feel the same way about Season Five as a whole. This is our most kick-butt content yet because we cover joy, pain, loyalty, betrayal, excitement, anger, sadness, and fear, sometimes within one episode.\n\nIt’s Holy Week, the most impactful and famous week in human history. Jerusalem is a powder keg with all of Jesus’ followers, enemies, and over a million Passover pilgrims packed into one small place. He shows sides of Himself we’ve never seen till now—turning over tables, literally cracking the whip, and weeping with heartbreak but also love. He also confuses His followers at every turn...and to what end?\n\nThe takeaway for you from this season: Can you believe and follow even when you don't understand?\n\nYes, it’s sad and heartbreaking because we’re getting closer to the cross, but we’re also going to get to see some of the most iconic and deeply moving moments from Scripture. The triumphal entry, the turning of the tables, the betrayal by Judas, and the Last Supper...all set against the biggest backdrop and sets we've ever used with a new widescreen format that demands to be seen on the big screen. But of course, we continue our obsession to humanize and authenticate everyone involved.\n\nThe table is set. I can't wait for you to see this in theaters.\n\nDallas Jenkins\nCreator, The Chosen\n\n---\nLearn more and get tickets: https://thechosenlastsupper.com/\n\nWatch The Chosen and find exclusive content free and easy on our app: https://www.thechosen.tv/en-us/explore/how-to-watch-the-chosen-season-4-app\n\nWear The Chosen gear and go deeper with our study materials: \nhttps://thechosengifts.com\n\nSupport The Chosen by donating to the Come and See Foundation: https://www.comeandsee.net/donate\n\n#thechosenlastsupper \n\n#BingeJesus by subscribing to our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/thechosenseries?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#GetUsedToDifferent by following us:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsideTheChosen\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thechosentvseries/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thechosentv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thechosentv",

        "description": "Thank you to all of you subscribers out there for quite frankly, making all this possible! We can’t wait to make more content for you guys over the coming months (and years) - next up, 2 videos we filmed in Malaysia!! \n\nHELLO FRIENDS and welcome to another video!! This week we are going to be showing you guys the ins ands outs of our entire renovation process for our new studio/office!! We have been haphazardly running around like chickens with our heads cut off for the last (8) years - and so we finally decided it was time to attempt to make our dream studio/office. And because we are huge fans of HGTV-style renovation content, we decided to renovate an old warehouse from top to bottom and document the entire process (also top to bottom). We may have bitten off more than we could chew - but we are pretty happy with how it turned out! What do you guys think of our new studio?\n\nA big thank you to Rove Concepts for gifting us a variety of awesome furniture pieces for our studio!

        "description": "A Delta Air Lines jet flipped on its roof while landing Monday at Toronto’s Pearson Airport, but all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries, the airport’s chief executive said.\r\n\r\nSnow was being blown by winds gusting to 40 mph (65 kph) when the flight from Minneapolis carrying 76 passengers and four crew attempted to land at around 2:15 p.m. Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it's not clear what went so drastically wrong when the plane touched down.\r\n\r\nCanadian authorities held two brief news conferences but provided no details on the crash. Video posted to social media only showed the aftermath with the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR overturned, the fuselage seemingly intact and firefighters dousing what was left of the fire as passengers climbed out and walked across the tarmac.\r\n\r\n“We are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries,” Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/delta-flight-toronto-airport-incident/507-81c8b0f2-16fa-4371-9ef5-2d9933d96952 --\n\nAt 3News, we’re not here to tell you the news, we’re here to share the stories that you say matter most to you.

I'm a Minecraft channel though, so of course we had to make it unique.\n\nWe coded a mod that makes it so you can scan things from real life into Minecraft. Of course the first thing we did with this mod was scan our ENTIRE HOUSE into Minecraft! We did this on Minecraft 1.21.4, but it's possible on basically any version! 1.8, 1.20, etc. The mod is called BlockPrintr.\n\nThis video is a mix of IRL vlog style content, and in game Minecraft content. Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support! Lots more cool stuff to come, another Titan Minecraft Manhunt is hopefully the next video! Comment down below ideas :)",

Check out https://joshjohnsoncomedy.com/tour for dates and to sign up for the waitlist to be notified when I'm performing in your city.\n\nHi Friends,\n\nThis week I wanted to share my thoughts on Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show and why I think it is impacting the country the way it is. \n\nKendrick Lamar has surpassed Michael Jackson for most watched superbowl halftime show and joins an incredible group of elite talent and star power in even performing. Rihanna, Usher, Justin Timberlake, Prince, and so many others have brought us halftime shows that reminded us of their hits like Diamonds, U Got It Bad, SexyBack, and Purple Rain. \n\nKendrick chose to do something different and that’s why we’re obsessed.\n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy Video \n\nRecorded at The Orange Peel in Asheville, NC",

        "description": "Bobby Carter | February 20, 2025\nOn the morning of Leon Thomas' Tiny Desk concert, many NPR staffers assumed the show was postponed due to a snowstorm in the D.C. area. Not only did he proactively schedule his coast-to-coast flight but he was also 30 minutes early to the office. With his sophomore album, MUTT, Thomas has planted his flag as the most exciting artist in R&B music today. The Tiny Desk had to happen now; nothing would get in the way of divine timing.\n\nThomas was destined to be an entertainer — he's been doing it for most of his life. His parents were both musicians and introduced him to their world early on. As an actor, he appeared in multiple Broadway plays before becoming a staple on the Nickelodeon network. Under the tutelage of Babyface, he earned his chops as a writer and producer, eventually penning and producing big hits in R&B and hip-hop.\n\nHe opens this set with three songs from MUTT and closes with two from 2023's Electric Dusk, including \"Breaking Point,\" which he dedicates to his recently deceased grandfather, the opera singer John Anthony: \"This is one of his favorite songs.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"VIBES DON'T LIE\"\n\"YES IT IS\"\n\"MUTT\"\n\"Breaking Point\" \n\"Treasure In The Hills\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeon Thomas: vocals, guitar\nChris Payton: guitar\nAli Roots: keys, piano\nJoe \"Jough\" Cleveland: bass\nQuintin \"Q\" Gulledge: drums\nTK: background vocals\nAyana Layli: background vocals\nSha'Leah Nikole: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Grace Raver\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #leonthomas",
