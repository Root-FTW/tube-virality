                "description": "Real Madrid took all three points at the Bernab\u00e9u against Legan\u00e9s, who had gone into the break leading 1-2. Previously, Mbapp\u00e9 had put Ancelotti's side ahead by converting a Panenka-style penalty. There was no option but to turn the game around after the break, and the equaliser came almost straight from the kick-off. In the 47th minute, Bellingham, with hardly any space, worked a shot inside the box but Dmitrovic responded with a fine save. The rebound fell to Brahim, his shot was blocked by Tapia on the line, but the ball hit the crossbar and Bellingham was on hand to acrobatically slot it home. The minutes ticked by and in the 76th minute came the deserved reward of the third goal. Mbapp\u00e9 scored from a masterful indirect free kick from the edge of the area, the Frenchman's second consecutive brace. From then until the end, Ancelotti's men were able to hold on to their advantage and take all three points.\n#RealMadridLegan\u00e9s | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n\ud83c\udd95\ud83d\udcfa RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa5  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCR\u00cdBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 FOLLOW US | S\u00cdGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

A couple of explorers, modern-day documentarians, and cultivators of curiosity.\n\nWe\u2019ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nThings We're Most Curious About...\n\nGETTING OFF-GRID \nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  So self-reliance and sustainable living are a must.  We've learned heaps about renewable energy, managing waste, creating safe drinking water and foraging for food.  We carefully manage our resources and we\u2019re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nTALKING TO STRANGERS\nPeople are busy (even on remote islands) and travelers are a dime a dozen.  It takes time to talk to strangers, and even more time to have a real connection.  Going the extra mile to get to know someone is a commitment. \n\nWhich is why these are our most treasured experiences.  Setting off into the world with curiosity as our guide and nature as our compass.  We talk to strangers and accept hospitality without fear or reservations.  Both giving and receiving.\n\nALTERNATIVE LIVING\nThese are people who are doing things differently. Forgoing the mainstream, seeking freedom and living on the margins. Creative, unique and inspiring people who challenge our ideas of home and community.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Thank You for the LOVE\n00:24 Belhaven Walking Trail\n01:43 Quickly Moving off our Catamaran\n03:26 Packing Up & Shipping our Home\n05:42 Flying from Davao to Dallas\n06:29 A Van Sailing & International Travel\n09:07 Chocolate Before Sailing\n09:59 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu 2016 Boat Shopping\n12:22 Sailing a Windelo 54\n13:17 Used Cat Shopping\n13:48 Xquisite Sailing & Bahamas Base\n14:25 Schionning Sailboats\n15:29 We're Open to Any Type of Boat\n16:29 Van Tour 2025 Transit Specs\n18:46 VanLife Interior\n21:20 Van Driver's Area\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #Sailboat #Travel #LifeStyle #vanlife \n\n\u00a9 Gone With the Wynns 2025",

A couple of explorers, modern-day documentarians, and cultivators of curiosity.\n\nWe\u2019ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nThings We're Most Curious About...\n\nGETTING OFF-GRID \nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  So self-reliance and sustainable living are a must.  We've learned heaps about renewable energy, managing waste, creating safe drinking water and foraging for food.  We carefully manage our resources and we\u2019re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nTALKING TO STRANGERS\nPeople are busy (even on remote islands) and travelers are a dime a dozen.  It takes time to talk to strangers, and even more time to have a real connection.  Going the extra mile to get to know someone is a commitment. \n\nWhich is why these are our most treasured experiences.  Setting off into the world with curiosity as our guide and nature as our compass.  We talk to strangers and accept hospitality without fear or reservations.  Both giving and receiving.\n\nALTERNATIVE LIVING\nThese are people who are doing things differently. Forgoing the mainstream, seeking freedom and living on the margins. Creative, unique and inspiring people who challenge our ideas of home and community.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Thank You for the LOVE\n00:24 Belhaven Walking Trail\n01:43 Quickly Moving off our Catamaran\n03:26 Packing Up & Shipping our Home\n05:42 Flying from Davao to Dallas\n06:29 A Van Sailing & International Travel\n09:07 Chocolate Before Sailing\n09:59 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu 2016 Boat Shopping\n12:22 Sailing a Windelo 54\n13:17 Used Cat Shopping\n13:48 Xquisite Sailing & Bahamas Base\n14:25 Schionning Sailboats\n15:29 We're Open to Any Type of Boat\n16:29 Van Tour 2025 Transit Specs\n18:46 VanLife Interior\n21:20 Van Driver's Area\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #Sailboat #Travel #LifeStyle #vanlife \n\n\u00a9 Gone With the Wynns 2025"

                "description": "Watch part 1 - https://youtu.be/NX8InjXV2OU?si=OeW3fydomgNVYyJW\nStream this song - https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/lydiathebardtonyhalliwell/take-the-shot-feat-benjamin-callins\n\nSo it felt right that this one got a part 2 ya know? Like what happens after Wendy falls? Did she die? What does Peter do? Fairies are still dying so like, thats still a problem. \n\nI had lots of fun with this one as you can probably tell! I wanted it to feel stylistically the same as the previous song with some new ideas and with a good finish to the story so that Tinks story could have a nice sharp full stop so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve attempted to do here. I hope you love it as much as we loved making it!!\n\nHUGE thank you to all the incredible people that helped this project some to life!! I\u2019ll be crediting them all below this \nstory so do go check out their work! \n\nVILLAIN STORY \n\nWendy is dead. Finally Tink and her friends were safe again, but was that a step too far? Tinkerbell had no other choice right? If she\u2019d let Wendy live then Peter Pan would\u2019ve left Neverland, left Tinkerbell and stopped believing in fairies. Tinks very existence had rested on a knife edge. So Wendy had to go.\u00a0\n\nThe first laugh of a newborn baby is what brings fairies into existence and, as Tink previously discovered, it is that same child that stops believing that then ends the same fairies life. Tink and her friends had found the children they were connected to, Peter Pan and the Lost boys. And Wendy and her brothers had almost taken them away until she\u2019d intervened. Now Tink and her friends were safe it was their responsibility to help the whole of Pixie Hollow. Fairies were still dying out, the other inhabitants were fading at an alarming rate.\n\nTo ensure their people\u2019s continued existence Tink and her friends would have to do something bigger, something drastic to ensure humans never stopped believing in fairies.\n\nLuckily Tink has been experimenting with Pixie Dust, searching for a way to bring fairies back from the dead. Sadly, she never did find a way to revive fawn and Silvermist. But she did happen upon a way to enhance their powers, weaponise them, to create an army charged with Pixie Dust. Tinkerbell knew that much power in one fairies hands was wrong, but with the crisis she was facing she didn\u2019t have a choice. \n\nNow with almost limitless power at her fingertips, Tink and her friends finally had a solution to their problem. But she has another foe to face first. Peter Pan won\u2019t sit idly by after the death of Wendy. Tink crossed a line she may well regret crossing very soon\u2026\n\n\nByyyeeeee\n\nPS.

Like what happens after Wendy falls? Did she die? What does Peter do? Fairies are still dying so like, thats still a problem. \n\nI had lots of fun with this one as you can probably tell! I wanted it to feel stylistically the same as the previous song with some new ideas and with a good finish to the story so that Tinks story could have a nice sharp full stop so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve attempted to do here.
