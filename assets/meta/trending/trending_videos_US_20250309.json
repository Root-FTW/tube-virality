                "description": "Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\nDon't forget to check out the CHESS SET!\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nWhat I'm Using (contains affiliate links):\nSquishy Makeovers Fixing Your Squishies #37\nTulip Matte Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/49OjdMp\nTulip Slick Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/3LBW6uO\nPosca Pens: https://amzn.to/40TgXPL\nScissors: https://amzn.to/3MjSY6L\nSandpaper: https://amzn.to/3EQOOPY\nFabric Hot Glue: https://amzn.to/3PQ4KZh\n\n\n_______FAQs________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them \"MEmes.\" I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes. \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nDrawings to Squishies: turning my flat drawings into squishies\nFinishing Art Ideas: Choosing art ideas from my giant list and making them happen\nSquishies I've Been Avoiding: Painting on the squishies I DON'T want to paint\n\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME Nail Polish\nslatebrands.com/menails\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nFOR GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:\nFanmail@Moriah.Video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\n\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

                    "description": "Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\nDon't forget to check out the CHESS SET!\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nWhat I'm Using (contains affiliate links):\nSquishy Makeovers Fixing Your Squishies #37\nTulip Matte Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/49OjdMp\nTulip Slick Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/3LBW6uO\nPosca Pens: https://amzn.to/40TgXPL\nScissors: https://amzn.to/3MjSY6L\nSandpaper: https://amzn.to/3EQOOPY\nFabric Hot Glue: https://amzn.to/3PQ4KZh\n\n\n_______FAQs________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them \"MEmes.\" I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes. \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nDrawings to Squishies: turning my flat drawings into squishies\nFinishing Art Ideas: Choosing art ideas from my giant list and making them happen\nSquishies I've Been Avoiding: Painting on the squishies I DON'T want to paint\n\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME Nail Polish\nslatebrands.com/menails\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nFOR GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:\nFanmail@Moriah.Video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\n\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.\n\n I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n\nThe second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n\nWith some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
