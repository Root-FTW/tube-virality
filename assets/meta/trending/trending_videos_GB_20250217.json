                "description": "We've had booing during anthems at NHL games and other sporting events for weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face-off. One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!"
