                    "description": "A Delta Air Lines jet flipped on its roof while landing Monday at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport, but all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries, the airport\u2019s chief executive said.\r\n\r\nSnow was being blown by winds gusting to 40 mph (65 kph) when the flight from Minneapolis carrying 76 passengers and four crew attempted to land at around 2:15 p.m. Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it's not clear what went so drastically wrong when the plane touched down.\r\n\r\nCanadian authorities held two brief news conferences but provided no details on the crash. Video posted to social media only showed the aftermath with the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR overturned, the fuselage seemingly intact and firefighters dousing what was left of the fire as passengers climbed out and walked across the tarmac.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries,\u201d Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/delta-flight-toronto-airport-incident/507-81c8b0f2-16fa-4371-9ef5-2d9933d96952 --\n\nAt 3News, we\u2019re not here to tell you the news, we\u2019re here to share the stories that you say matter most to you.
