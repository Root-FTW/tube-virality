So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 brand new LTx!\n02:01 Outside truck tour\n08:08 Inside camper tour\n22:05 the roof \n23:15 driving the Moki dugway\n26:39 Valley of the Gods campsite\n29:50 first time using invisacook! \n32:32 Nates big announcement! \n34:24 my solo adventure\n45:36 smoking dinner\n47:42 Final thoughts",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 brand new LTx!\n02:01 Outside truck tour\n08:08 Inside camper tour\n22:05 the roof \n23:15 driving the Moki dugway\n26:39 Valley of the Gods campsite\n29:50 first time using invisacook! \n32:32 Nates big announcement! \n34:24 my solo adventure\n45:36 smoking dinner\n47:42 Final thoughts"

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\nDon't forget to check out the CHESS SET!\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nWhat I'm Using (contains affiliate links):\nSquishy Makeovers Fixing Your Squishies #37\nTulip Matte Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/49OjdMp\nTulip Slick Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/3LBW6uO\nPosca Pens: https://amzn.to/40TgXPL\nScissors: https://amzn.to/3MjSY6L\nSandpaper: https://amzn.to/3EQOOPY\nFabric Hot Glue: https://amzn.to/3PQ4KZh\n\n\n_______FAQs________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously.

                "description": "The 2025 Cadillac Escalade ESV V-Series  ($212,099 starting in Canada, $165,500 starting in the US) has seen several updates for this model year, and is ready to defend its best-selling title. The 6.2 L supercharged V8 engine is unchanged, but it has seen some styling changes inside and out. This includes an absolutely massive 55 inch screen in the dash, carbon fiber trim bits, 24 inch wheels, new light designs and other changes. But does the new Escalade V command its hefty price tag? And are the latest changes in the right direction? Thomas and James can\u2019t wait to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

                    "description": "The 2025 Cadillac Escalade ESV V-Series  ($212,099 starting in Canada, $165,500 starting in the US) has seen several updates for this model year, and is ready to defend its best-selling title. The 6.2 L supercharged V8 engine is unchanged, but it has seen some styling changes inside and out. This includes an absolutely massive 55 inch screen in the dash, carbon fiber trim bits, 24 inch wheels, new light designs and other changes. But does the new Escalade V command its hefty price tag? And are the latest changes in the right direction? Thomas and James can\u2019t wait to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.\n\n I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n\nThe second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n\nWith some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #water  #forge #fire",

It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #water  #forge #fire"
