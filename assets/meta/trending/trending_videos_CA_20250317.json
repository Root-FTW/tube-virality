                "description": "KCD2 Is here and it is rapidly becoming one of the greatest RPGs of all time! Of course as a fan of open world sandbox rpgs like skyrim I am drawn to the adventure that kingdom come deliverance has to offer. Of course similar to your average elder scrolls game the developers have left in some perfectly balanced game design choices that might result in the spiffing brit having to ask an important question. Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 A Perfectly balanced game with no exploits? Or perhaps are there bugs, glitches and overpowered features that spiff can use to turn himself into a god. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nChapters:\n00:00 Hello Henry \n00:32 Green Thumb\n02:58 Let Him Cook\n04:22 He can go all night\n07:03 Gimblong\n09:23 Stop!

                    "description": "KCD2 Is here and it is rapidly becoming one of the greatest RPGs of all time! Of course as a fan of open world sandbox rpgs like skyrim I am drawn to the adventure that kingdom come deliverance has to offer. Of course similar to your average elder scrolls game the developers have left in some perfectly balanced game design choices that might result in the spiffing brit having to ask an important question. Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 A Perfectly balanced game with no exploits? Or perhaps are there bugs, glitches and overpowered features that spiff can use to turn himself into a god. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.

There's something about the curved roof, the stained glass windows and the rounded doors that remind me of a modern hobbit-like home that just radiates warmth, character and comfort. \n\nPhilippa is a remarkable woman. I enjoyed my time with her immensely. I can always tell when I meet a kindred spirit and I felt this way with her. You know that when you meet a person who can talk with penguins, you've met someone very special indeed. She has lived a big life and done some remarkable things, One of those things is building her tiny house. A very bespoke home that sings to her soul. \n\nAnd this home! Beautiful and character filled. It's enough, and yet it's so much more. From the beautiful shapes and all the wonderful adornments this is a house that radiates a very real sensation of home. \n\nNature has very few right angles, and that trait is shared with this tiny home. A true labour of love for Philippa and her builders, this is a tiny house not to be forgotten. Crafted with sacred geometric principles in mind, this could very easily be your new favourite tiny home.

We're calling it Glenns revenge. This includes a gigantic battle and also a massive tease for the future. That post credit scenes all completely new and we have some theories for that too.\n\nWhere the main focus is though is with Conquest Vs Mark. Starting right in at the title we pick up where we left off last week. That title at the start means we're diving right into it and we see punch play out. It's completely earth shattering and the shockwaves a big way to kick off the fight. Mentioning Anissa sales pitch Conquest says the the truth is that he wants him to resist.\n\nThis is almost beat for beat...for beat like how it is in the comics with them perfectly recapturing the fight. If you wanna dive into the books then you need to pick up issue 62. From here if you work to 65 you'll have basically the outline of the comics.\n\nMost of the episode is one to one, however they change up a lot of moments of the dialogue.\n\nConquest is voiced by Jeffrey Dean Morgan which is such a great fourth wall breaking moment. Thats because both him and Steven Yeun worked with Kirkman on The Walking Dead. \n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n\u25ba Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25ba Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n\u25ba Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n\u25ba Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/",

We're calling it Glenns revenge. This includes a gigantic battle and also a massive tease for the future. That post credit scenes all completely new and we have some theories for that too.\n\nWhere the main focus is though is with Conquest Vs Mark. Starting right in at the title we pick up where we left off last week. That title at the start means we're diving right into it and we see punch play out. It's completely earth shattering and the shockwaves a big way to kick off the fight. Mentioning Anissa sales pitch Conquest says the the truth is that he wants him to resist.\n\nThis is almost beat for beat...for beat like how it is in the comics with them perfectly recapturing the fight. If you wanna dive into the books then you need to pick up issue 62. From here if you work to 65 you'll have basically the outline of the comics.\n\nMost of the episode is one to one, however they change up a lot of moments of the dialogue.\n\nConquest is voiced by Jeffrey Dean Morgan which is such a great fourth wall breaking moment. Thats because both him and Steven Yeun worked with Kirkman on The Walking Dead. \n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n\u25ba Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25ba Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n\u25ba Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n\u25ba Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/"
