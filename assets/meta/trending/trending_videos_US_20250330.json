She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma.

In true Wicked Makers fashion, we didn\u2019t stop at scary\u2026 we cranked it up to horrifying. Using steel, pneumatics, and a whole lot of trial and error, we created a terrifying DIY Halloween animatronic and then tested its bite strength with a ballistic gel arm to see if Yarnaby could really take a chunk out of someone. Spoiler: it got messy. If you're into DIY Halloween props, animatronic builds, or just love ridiculous horror props, you're going to love this chaotic creation.\n\nThis video is packed with behind-the-scenes madness, prop-making tips, and a full breakdown of how we built Yarnaby from scratch. Whether you're making your own haunted house props, dreaming up Halloween decor, or just love creepy DIY animatronics, this is the ultimate Poppy Playtime build for the spooky season. And if you love mascot horror, we\u2019ve got a ton more custom animatronics from FNAF, Poppy Playtime, and even The Walten Files on our channel. Subscribe for more Wicked DIY horror projects and join Jay and Jaimie as we test the limits of what a homemade Halloween animatronic can actually do.

In true Wicked Makers fashion, we didn\u2019t stop at scary\u2026 we cranked it up to horrifying. Using steel, pneumatics, and a whole lot of trial and error, we created a terrifying DIY Halloween animatronic and then tested its bite strength with a ballistic gel arm to see if Yarnaby could really take a chunk out of someone. Spoiler: it got messy. If you're into DIY Halloween props, animatronic builds, or just love ridiculous horror props, you're going to love this chaotic creation.\n\nThis video is packed with behind-the-scenes madness, prop-making tips, and a full breakdown of how we built Yarnaby from scratch. Whether you're making your own haunted house props, dreaming up Halloween decor, or just love creepy DIY animatronics, this is the ultimate Poppy Playtime build for the spooky season. And if you love mascot horror, we\u2019ve got a ton more custom animatronics from FNAF, Poppy Playtime, and even The Walten Files on our channel. Subscribe for more Wicked DIY horror projects and join Jay and Jaimie as we test the limits of what a homemade Halloween animatronic can actually do. Stay Wicked!\n\n#Yarnaby\n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics"

Man, im looking for the littest lit bitches in the city. \nWho gon really get the littest\nWhere the niggas that\u2019s the Trillest? \nBreak yo back if you know that you the biggest \n\nBounce that ass. Hoe shake them titties. Man, im looking for the littest lit bitches in the city. \nWho gon really get the littest\nWhere the niggas that\u2019s the Trillest? \nBreak yo back if you know that you the biggest \n\nStep up in the spot; I ain\u2019t playing games \nDrop it like it\u2019s hot; Tana came to flame \nBody still banging; but this beat smoking \nA puff of this kitty cat will have yo ass choking \nMugler body suit; jet black hair. \nMy pussy getting wet & I forgot my underwear\nStill a bad bitch! Born to ball \nIn yo nigga top ten; hoe find a flaw \n\nNow bitch! Bounce! Bounce!\nGet up hoe! Grab the wall. Pop dat! \nBitch walk it like a dog! \nHoe bounce!

Authorities in the Thai capital have already received 169 calls about building damage.\n\nA British holidaymaker described how window panes started \u201cpopping out of the side\u201d of the building next to his hotel as the earthquake hit Bangkok.\n\n\u201cWe were out by the pool on the 11th floor at the Rembrandt Hotel and my girlfriend asked me if the floor was moving when she was lying on the bed. And then suddenly I realised it was also moving,\u201d Kurt Bull, from Norwich, said.\n\nHe is spending ten days on holiday in Thailand with his Swedish partner, Sigrid.\n\n\u201cThen the building beside the Rembrandt started moving a lot and was really creaking,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could hear cracking of the structure, and the smaller glass windows were popping out at the side of the building.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to leave the pool area, all of the tiles and some of the roof in the stairwell had come down and smashed all over the floor, and I had no shoes with me so I was barefoot, so I didn\u2019t want to go through the tower.\u201d\n\nRead the best of our journalism: https://www.thetimes.com/\nSubscribe to The Times and The Sunday Times YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=timesonlinevideo\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/timesandsundaytimes/\nFind us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thetimes\nFind us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thetimes/\n\n#thailand #warthquake #bangkok"
